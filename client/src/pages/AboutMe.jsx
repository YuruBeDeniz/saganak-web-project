      <h3>This is my not interesting story..</h3>
      <p> I am a former humanitarian worker who worked for refugees for 
      more than 3 years. It wasn't enough, so I did a master on top of it.
      After Corona hit my life (like everyone else's) I had plenty of time to 
      think about what I really want to do..
      Last year I made a decision to follow my dreams, quit my job and went to a bootcamp
      to become a fullstack developer! I can proudly say that this was one of the best decision of my life.
      And now, I am a part time developer and a part time juggler. In my free times, I do (and sometimes teach) capoeira.</p>
